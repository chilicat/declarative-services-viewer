# A OSGi Declarative Service Viewer
The plugin will add a action called "View Declarative Services..." to the Tools menu. The action will open a new ToolWindow called "Declarative Services"
on the bottom. The ToolWindow will the project for Service Components.

The Viewer does support currently:
* XML Service Component declaration
    All service components which are registered in the MANIFEST.MF will be scanned and displayed.
* Felix Service Components
    All services which are annotated with Felix SCR annotations will be scanned and displayed.
